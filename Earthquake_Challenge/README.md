# Mapping_Earthquakes
Module 13

## CHALLENGE

For this challenge we created a map that plots all of the earthquakes in the last 7 days, sourcing data from the United States Geological Survey GeoJSON Feed page. The map illustrates the relationship between seismic activity and the earth's tectonic plates. The map employs three different view styles, selectedable by the user. The user also has the option to turn on or off overlays showing the earthquakes and/or tectonic plates.

The solution employs the following: Leaflet & Mapbox, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, D3, and GeoJSON source files
